Loopstudios juniour project

Made with react.js Font awesome

1. What I learned
   I think after making many mistakes and seeing weird bugs by trying to make this project, next time I would use bootstrap or some other library. I would plan my containers better so the page flow would be decent. However its kinda responsive there are many bugs with my design I think using bootstrap would save me effort and make my process more efficient and less difficult.

Planning my containers better would save me from many bugs in the responsiveness and using bootstrap would help me implement better responsive.
